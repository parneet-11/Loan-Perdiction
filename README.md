# Loan Prediction ML Project

This repository contains a Google Colab Notebook that performs **Loan Approval Prediction** using machine learning.  
The project includes data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification models to predict whether a loan application will be approved.

## üìÇ Project Structure
- `LoanPrediction.ipynb` ‚Äî Main notebook (can be run in Jupyter or Colab)  
- `train.csv` ‚Äî Dataset (must be provided by user, e.g., from Kaggle)  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

Install dependencies with:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

---

## Steps to Run 

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/loan-prediction-ml.git

2. Place the dataset (train.csv) in the root folder.

3. Upload to Google Colab.
   
4. Run the cells step by step:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Data Cleaning (handle missing values, duplicates, categorical features)
  - Feature Engineering
  - Model Training & Evaluation

## üìä Models Implemented

1. Logistic Regression
- Evaluated with Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision
2. Decision Tree Classifier
- Evaluated with Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, F1-score, Recall
